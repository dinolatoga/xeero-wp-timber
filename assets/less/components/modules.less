// GUIDE:
// Modules are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on. (http://smacss.com/book/categorizing)
// Modules are standalone, reusable components that have no knowledge of their parent container. Their only dependencies are the app’s base styles. We can safely delete a module when it’s no longer needed without causing changes elsewhere in our CSS. (http://webuild.envato.com/blog/how-to-scale-and-maintain-legacy-css-with-sass-and-smacss/)
